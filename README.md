# HackBio-Genomics-Workshop 

Find all the tasks related to the taining!

STAGE ZERO : Used BASH to carry out basic and introductory tasks

STAGE ONE: Worked with simple biological datasets

Softwares used:
1. fastqc (quality control)
2. multiQC (assembling quality control reports)
3. fastp (trimming sequence adapters) 
4. fastx (fastq_to_fasta : convert fastq to fasta) 
(optional)
6. bwa (assembling genomes)
7. samtools (manipulating sam/bam/cram files) 

Note: All the results are stored in output file and the sample datasets are in the raw_reads file
